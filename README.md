# Wesagn-Kunet

Our project is about making the paper dependent system of birth, marriage, and death recording of the Ethiopian Kebele/ Wereda System to a digitalized system that can record, edit , and delete information given that the person has the right privelages. People can also book their reservations for updating the information online.

Business feature #1 Identification - identification refers to the process of associating a specific person with a specific identity. It is considered an important process because it addresses certain concerns about an individual, such as “Is the person who he/she claims to be?”, “Has this person been here before?”, or “Should this individual be allowed access to our system?”. A username, process ID, smart card, or anything else that may uniquely identify a subject or person can be used for identification.
