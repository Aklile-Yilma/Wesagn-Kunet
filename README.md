# Wesagn-Kunet

Our project is about making the paper dependent system of birth, marriage, and death recording of the Ethiopian Kebele/ Wereda System to a digitalized system that can record, edit , and delete information given that the person has the right privelages. People can also book their reservations for updating the information online.
